# Sinatra caesar code

This is a project from the online bootcamp 'Odin Project' :

This is a mix of 2 exercise. The first one was to make an easy 'caesar code' application :

(Caesarâ€™s code or Caesar shift is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.)

The second exercise was to try SINATRA (as an introduction to learn how to use Rails) and adapt the previous code to it :

It was fun to make an interactive application accessible on a webpage for the first time !
